The Flyweight Design Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern and one of the Gang of Four design patterns.
The Flyweight pattern is used to minimize the memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects.
The Flyweight pattern provides a way to reduce the number of objects created
and to decrease memory footprint and increase performance.
The Flyweight pattern tries to reuse already existing similar kind objects by storing them in a collection
which act like a cache and creates new object when no matching object is found.
The Flyweight objects we create as immutable. This means that they cannot be modified once they have been constructed.
 Making flyweight objects as immutable helps while sharing them with other objects.
